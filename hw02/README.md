I looked into the interactions between population, GDP and life expectancies to try and understand why Sri Lanka is not performing as well, economically, as its peers.

Progress Report - Used to R to create a mark down document. - Changed name of previous folder and created new subfolders for hw01 and hwo02. - Really enjoyed playing with dplyr and ggplot 2. - Encountered difficulty when trying to perform a relative analysis. Managed to overcome it by referencing [class notes]((http://stat545.com/block010_dplyr-end-single-table.html)) - Found it difficult to plot multiple time series data on one plot. Managed to overcome it by referening [stackexhcange]((https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29357612/plot-labels-at-ends-of-lines)). - Managed to find some interesting trends, which I have highlighted in my [analysis]((https://github.com/navysealtf9k/STAT545-hw-Farouk-Abdullah/blob/master/hw02/hw02-Analysis_of_Gapminder_Dataset.md))
