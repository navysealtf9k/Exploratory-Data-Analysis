Indeed!

### Progress Report
I pulled and edited the README document on Rstudio. In additon to that I created an R-markdown document for the gapminder dataset on R as well. It was relatively easy to pull and make changes, given my familiarity with R, than it was for me to make these changes on the browser.

I used the sample template to experiment with most of the editing features on R markdown. In addition I enjoyed learning how to use the link feature. This was initially tricky but upon realization that it was a synctatical error, it became relatively easy to embed them into the document.

I was unsure of how to extend analysis on the gapminder dataset. Hence I chose to answer questions I thought would be interesting. It provided me with a nifty opportunity to embed code chunks and graphs. I had difficulty trying to generate the md file for it. Upon consultation with a friend I realized I had to knit it to generate and not manually type it in at the start of the document.
